## Acceptance Criteria

Building a React-based frontend interface for displaying data from and interacting with an IoT device.

- **Retrieve the device's state** from the backend. (Done)
- **Show each of the device's readings**: name, unit, value, timestamp, and active status. (Done)
- **Show a counter** showing how many readings are active and how many are inactive. (done)
- **Implement a search input** that filters visible readings by name. (done)
- A user should also be able to **toggle the active status of each reading** by making the proper requests to the backend. After successfully changing the status on the backend, the UI should display the updated state of the active counter, or handle any errors appropriately. (Done)
